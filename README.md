Capstone Project Hub - README
This document provides an overview of the Capstone Project Hub (dashboard.html), an all-in-one interactive dashboard created to manage, document, and showcase our capstone project, "The Office Apocalypse Algorithm."

What is the Project Hub?
The Project Hub is a single, self-contained HTML file that functions as a complete website for our project. It is designed to be the central source of truth for our team and a comprehensive showcase for our professor and other stakeholders. It brings together project management, documentation, and interactive demonstrations into one clean interface.

Key Features
The Hub is organized into several tabs, each serving a specific purpose:

Interactive Dashboard: The core project management tool. Here, we can track all tasks across different project phases, assign them to team members, and monitor our progress in real-time with automatically updating progress bars.

Project Documentation: Contains all essential project documents, including the official Project Overview Statement (POS), team member roles, and links to all datasets and foundational research papers.

Technical Methodology: A detailed blueprint of our data science workflow, from data integration and feature engineering to our model training and evaluation strategy.

Live Model Demo: An interactive simulator that allows users to input hypothetical building characteristics and receive a live vacancy risk prediction, demonstrating the core functionality of our algorithm.

Final Results: A showcase for the project's final outcomes, including our champion model's performance metrics, a geospatial heatmap of our findings, and a summary of our key conclusions.

GitHub Repository: A direct link to the project's public code repository, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

How to Use
Simply open the dashboard.html file in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge). No installation or special software is required.

Important Note on Data Persistence
The dashboard is designed to save your progress (checked boxes, status changes, etc.) automatically. This information is stored in your browser's localStorage.

This means: Your progress is saved on the computer and in the browser where you make the changes.

This does NOT mean: The progress is automatically synced with your teammates. Each team member's dashboard will track their own view of the project's status. It is a tool to aid in personal and team organization.
